Description: Collection of functions useful for estimating/modelling flight costs
    in animal (vertebrate) flight. It features an implementation of the aerodynamic
    power model described in Klein Heerenbrink et al. 2015 Proc.R.Soc.A 471: 20140952.
    The package takes inspiration from the Flight program developed by Colin 
    Pennycuick (Pennycuick 2008 Modelling the flying bird. Amsterdam, The Netherlands:
    Elsevier.). The afpt package allows the user to estimate animal flight 
    performance based on basic morphological measurements such as body mass, wingspan
    and wing area.
